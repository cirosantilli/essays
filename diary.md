## 2014-06 Mozilla Sprint 2014

Talked on Skype with WriteLaTeX John Lees-Miller, W3C editor Robin Berjon, MathJax fred-wang and other similar minded people.

I told Berjon about the IETF desire to standardize a Markdown MIME-type, he immediately replied: what good is it to have a MIME-type for an underspecified format? Exactly what I had thought at first. He's sharp.

## 2014-11-25 Dancing with little Chinese girl

I was dancing in Place de la République, when a small girl came with her mother.

The girl started watching me, then came over. I looked at the mother to see if it was OK, she smiled, and so I started dance / playing with the little girl.

Her happiness was so pure and intoxicating, not a trace of violence in her action, pure carelessness. And on top of that she was East Asian, which is my weakness, her mother, who wore a hijab http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/24118241, later told me they were from Singapore.

When her mother said it was time to go, she didn't want to leave.

## 2014-12-12 Interview at QuartetFS [job]

Today I did my second job interview with the branch head of the enterprise QuartetFS, and he said he will send me a contract tonight. A few thoughts which I had heard many people talk about before, but now have I felt more strongly than ever.

-   I had a friend from university who works for the company, John. He gave me the email of his boss. If I didn't know him, the most likely path of entry would be through a recruitment agency who contacted me. Another friend, which is a capable as I, was contacted for this job, but was rejected after this interview. I got lucky.

    The interesting thing is that I wasn't making a huge effort to find a job, and had turned down three recruitment agencies who contacted me before because I found that the jobs, while financially and carrier-wise good, were not very interesting.

    It was after getting contacted by one of those recruitment agencies that I contacted John, who had casually told me he worked on a similar thing earlier, asking if it was the same, and he said no, I work for another one. I asked if they were hiring, he asked his boss and said yes and gave me the email.

    I sat on that email for three months, until I met John by chance on the subway, he told me how everything was going fine at the company, and I decided to apply.

    Me and John were not super close friends. I never called him or anything. But I had always felt an affinity for the guy, for some unexplainable reason. I always enjoyed talking to him when we met, more than average with other people. It was this unexplainable affinity that led not only him to give me the contact of his boss, but also me to look more into his company and actually notice that they were doing very interesting things.

    Like minded people get together. You don't even have to make an effort.

-   While you are talking, the interviewer is taking notes.

    The importance of what you say to him is proportional to the speed at which he jumps to take the note.

    Some of the questions I expected him to take note, but I was surprised by how fast he noted a few others:

    - when talking about motivation to improve the world, I said that my parents have a very high moral standard
    - when asked how I chose the enterprise, I said I mostly excluded I didn't want to do
    - school grades (B / C but never flunked)

## 2015-05-28

Xiaohua's birthday.

I bought some sweets for breakfast.

Lin Jie, her good friend, called me so that I would not forget, because Xiaohua always tells her I'm very forgetful, but I hadn't. It was funny and thoughtful, she is a friend to be trusted.

We got the letter Xiaohua's naturalization was adjourned, bad birthday gift :-)

## 2015-06-03

Passed IBM online test. Two types of questions:

- given a sequence of numbers, which of the ones below fits the patter?
- model 2 line problems and solve systems of linear equations in 2 variables real quick

So stupid, nothing to do with actual programming. Not sure I want to work there anymore.

## 2015-06-22

Fete de la musique.

At midnight the police told us that the noise was legal, and we had to go to a hotel to sleep.

Xiaohua found on the website that is should go up to 00h30, but they had others otherwise because we live in a street with many bars.

## 2015-06-26

USA supreme court said gay marriage is legal in all states.

Stack Overflow, GitHub and Google search "gay" added rainbow easter eggs to their websites, Facebook an image editor that adds the rainbow flag to your picture https://www.facebook.com/celebratepride

## 2015-07-13

We went to eat on a Chinese restaurant near our home yesterday evening.

I was tired.

The food is not nearly as good as the best places in Paris.

But I was really happy: 19h hours is too early for the French to eat, so we were the only ones there.

The boss was eating, there were some close friends of her there having tea and chatting, and her son was there as well.

It felt like a home, like happy people chatting and cooking, not working just to get money.

## 2015-07-14

Suddenly my GF wanted to learn how to use GitHub.

She was on Mac, and does not know how to use the CLI. A few notes:

Likely because I talk a lot about it, but also because she thinks Octocat is cute.

The result: <https://github.com/xiaohuaai/test>

Notes:

-   GitHub is impossible to use for non-programmers.

-   I tried to add a mathematician theme to the lesson, and made her create a `.tex` file.

-   GitHub for Mac needs a really recent Mac OS X, so we went for the command line

-   it is really hard to show `.dot` files on Mac OS Finder...

-   by default you cannot install apps on Mac that are not from the app store! Needs to change a config for that

-   `git add .` should be the default for beginners. They should never worry about the index which is a major confusions point. I almost never use the index myself, but rather `.gitignore` and branches.

-   the first baby steps are:

    - create a new repo
    - make a new revision
    - fix an issue by creating a new revision
    - create an issue on someone else's repo
    - accept a pull request
    - create a pull request
    - rebase a pull request

    The most important thing is to show people how to see the inner states of git:

    - log for revisions
    - status for index

## 2015-08-21 Amazonas on education

Met a teacher from my father's university, friend of my father's GF who is leaving close to Barcelona which I'm visiting.

He tried to improve education in obvious ways along giving students more choice, his colleagues didn't like and didn't try to understand, so he retired and now works on EU projects. Great waste for Brazil!

The most interesting thing he said I didn't know: currently it is hard to upgrade laboratories, because the current teaching method is to put 50 people on a lab and to the experiment at the same time, so you need 50 times the same tools.

But if instead we would let students take initiative, reserve laboratory time, and to at different times, much more could be done!

While I was talking to him, I though that his way of looking at people looked a lot like my father: as if looking from over the glasses and tilting the head down. I didn't say anything, but when Xiaohua told me she noticed that, I was like: OMG, it truly is like my father.

Another interesting thing is that he didn't know how to behave in the present of a judge in an informal setting when he met my father, because of the huge amount of dulling that judges get in course. Hopefully he was pleasantly surprised.

## 2015-08-23 Selling GitHub for maths

I am at the Centro de Ciencias de Benasque, Spain with my GF where she is attending a mathematics conference for PHD / post-grads, around 5- people total, 

I want to make a 5 minute presentation at the end of some course of Git and GitHub and offer to help them out. Sales training, but really useful for them to make math books.

In the coffee break of the first day, I've tried to talk to one of the organizers, a woman with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alopecia_totalis , to ask for permission.

I've lurked on the coffee break, until the was free, and I attacked.

She first though I was asking about application of mathematics for computer science, but when she understood that it was more of scientific communication, she said "You might be able to do it but maybe not today" and slipped away without trying to understand why Git rocks. My presentation quality was average, I still have to learn what buttons to push for mathematicians.

She told me however that her husband who is also an organizer does code. Going to talk to him another time.

I was really glad that my GF talked to her friends about it out of her own initiative, and even found one mathematician who codes a bit and knew GitHub.

She really believes in what I do even though she does not fully understand it, much like I do in her job. That made me really happy.

Also I saw her taking to a friend, the point that she pushed the most was that this huge important maths project, the Stacks project of Columbia U, is hosted there.

Before she mentioned this point, her math friend just frowned as if "I don't care". But when she did mentioned it, her attention was greatly increased. Youtube effect and content is king is the way.

Seeing people's reaction to how you sell is a great measure of what points to use to convince them

## 2015-09-28 Supermoon Lunar Eclipse

<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/11895052/Supermoon-lunar-eclipse-2015-Amazing-pictures-of-once-in-a-generation-event-live.html>

On same day: Chinese mid autumn festival, helped Xiaoxiao move to new house.

## 2015-11 Rennes

Went to Rennes to talk with https://www.linkedin.com/in/erven-rohou-5370b31 about http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/100882/ing%C3%A9nieur-r-d-en-compilation-h-f-cdd-3-ans-inria

The city is was nice, and I've learnt a lot while talking to him.

The big boss of the laboratry was cool was well, he talked to us informally https://team.inria.fr/alf/members/andre-seznec/ and showed us the last circuit he made: 25 years ago! Now they make CPU optimizations, like cache algorithms.

Going there was a really good idea to get the feeling of the city before taking a job.

Then I walked around the city.

I've also met: Fernando Akira Endo https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=AAEAAAVg_0IBYNBjkxiqLSRUnGJ7ANEM6P4LaN4&authType=name&authToken=Is-8&trk=prof-sb-how_conn-name-link

## 2015-11-13 ISIS Terrorist attacks

I was walking on the street one hour before them besides my home.

When I got home, my friend Rafael called me to ask if I was alright. I had no idea it had happened. The Charrone attack was really close to our home.

## 2015-11-20 Interview with Cyrille Béraud from Savoir-faire Linux

The way his eyes moves from side to side, in an act of calculation (necessary for business deciders!), reminded me of Georges Bory from QuartetFS.

Now that I look back, I felt a bit nostalgic about it! It was a great experience, my first real feel of an enterprise.

I wasn't expecting a job, because their embedded team is in Montreal, but the enterprise seemed really interesting, so I just went to meet him.

His method is very interesting:

- first say all the great things about the enterprise: achievements, people, etc.
- then say that the job is really hard, that you will have deal with a lot of BS, etc.
- then ask how much you want. He joked that Brazillians are mercenaries as if it were too much :-) but then said seriously that it was fair.
- then at the very end, make you a job offer! I was really surprised. This is what I like about enterprise over research: the directness and sense of urgency. If you think a risk is worth taking, you just take it.

Also, unlike the technical interview with the people from Quartet, he took no notes of me.

He didn't ask me anything technical, just to access myself.

*That* is how you pick someone. The only way to see if he works well for you is to try it out (unfortunate that French labour law is overprotective).

## 2015-11-26 Came back to Brazil

When I got home, the smells came back to me.

All those places I've seen a thousand times but don't think about anymore.

And a few ones that I've seen a thousand times, and see in my dreams from time to time.

## 2015-12-10 Physics course to Melissa

She didn't know that Microsoft was paid. That is the ultimate monopoly.

The product is so default, that users don't know it anymore, even though they use it every day.

## 2015-12-25 Ribeirao preto

Gabriel, my cousin, told me that I was too concentrated on Wikipedia on my uncle's smartphone while everyone else was chatting away how to say "couve" in English. Such a huge compliment. I told him that you either focus or get lost into useless noise forever. And I was the one to find it in the end: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collard_greens

## 2016-01-13 Back to Paris after Brazil

First impressions:

- I like the cold, makes me feel a sexy / nostalgic kind of pleasure
- overheard some smart youngsters talking about their Electrical Engineering courses. Reminded me of the massacre of Polytechnique, and made me feel a bit bad, but hopeful for such a country full of great minds.

## 2016-01 Father hits the butcher's balance for playing with my mother

My mother told me this story, which happened somewhere in the early 2000s. It was not the first time I've heard it.

She went to the butcher, and he had the bad habit of playing pranks on costumers (mostly women I bet...).

He grabbed my mother's foot without her seeing it, and started imitating the bark of a dog.

My mother was startled, but not too offended, and left.

Later on, she casually told this to my father while walking with him. She said it was a phase in which my father was a bit depressive.

The other day, when my father came back home, she told her that the matter was settled.

He had passed by the butcher, scolded him badly for playing such pranks (sexually related?), and hit his meat balance hard with the hand.

My mother was completely embarrassed by this, but now that I hear it, I think it was well deserved (the only problem being the risk of getting shot by some crazy butcher).

My mother stopped going to that butcher of course, and told my father that now he would have to take her by car to another butcher, because that was the only good one close by.

One day, my mother went to the baker's (which because of Portuguese immigration in Brazil is more like a French café), and she came across the butcher and his assistant by chance who were drinking some coffee.

She apologized for her husband, but the assistant took my mother's side, said that he kept telling his boss that he should stop with those silly pranks.

I bet he did stop after this time.

## 2016-04-25 Xiaoxiao and Fang sheng eat with us

Xiaoxiao is pregnant, and getting sick easily.

She wanted to eat something different, so they came over (specially since Xiaohua cooks well).

It was a really pleasant evening, just eating hot stuff, rainy outside, and half understanding Chinese.

We bough stuff at the Chinese quarters earlier before.

## 2016-11-22 Heat equation

Went to workplace at 11pm, played around with https://github.com/cirosantilli/cpp-cheat/tree/907ab0bd7bc0a194cbcc79d76405af6873fca695 until 1AM. Felt intense beauty, and that education system sucks.

We must be brutally practical. Want to learn the heat equation? Write a solver, and do a physics experiment, and match them. Theory only matters if it makes you better in practice. Theory is either improved practical technique, or it is useless.

It is a miracle that I got interested in maths at all. God is the only explanation? If only my memory didn't suck and I remembered when I was little, and where the balance tilted.

Will I ever be able to transmit this feeling to younger people?

## 2017-01-10 Back to England from Brazil

I was sad to leave, but when I got to the Gatwick train, King's Cross, and Cambridge home, I felt really glad I was here! Maybe this wasn't a bad choice after all!
