# Questions for my future self

Future self, answer these.

## 10 years

- 2017-2027: did self-driving cars become big?
- 2017-2027: did Virtual reality become big?

## 20 years

-   2018-2038: companies offer free full genome decoding just to get your genomic data and sell it to pharma companies.

    Someone like me then creates an open source genomic database funded by health organizations that publishes genomes + phenotypes anonymously. Genome to phenotype analytics go crazy big.

## 40 years

- 2017-2057: was human level AI reached (by non-bio devices :-)), even if very slow?
- 2017-2057: did China become democratic?
- 2018-2058: full [brain computer interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface), with complete understanding of spinal cord, eye and ear output signals + the ability to generate input signals. Ear might be be the first, since it is the least serious one if things go wrong, and likely has the simplest signal.
