# My personality

I am intensely passionate about useful knowledge that can make the world better, more than most. This is well explained at: http://www.cirosantilli.com/interests/

My memory sucks. This is my greatest strength. It leads me to write and analyze everything down into perfect tutorials that allow me to remember stuff. It leads me to automate everything perfectly, because I have zero tolerance for "I did this a while back something along these lines".

Because of that, I am an experimentalist. First try stuff out, then deduce theories from it. Learning theory first is bullshit. I dream of making the perfect physics experiment YouTube Channel. In programming, I love debuggers way more than reading source code, as it gives me immediate visibility.

I derive less satisfaction than most people do from socializing with friends. Unless people are talking about things that I consider work-useful, in which case I become intensely interested, and start checking whatever they mention on my cell-phone. I have learnt never to go somewhere far with people where I know I can't escape back home immediately as I get bored.

I am a generalist, hyperlinker, theory builder https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/04/the_two_cultures_of_mathematic.html Higher throughput, higher latency person. I Interruptions my ability to finish a single task quickly, since I by default am interested in several tasks all the time. This is the main reason why I'm not a "genius": I tend to have too many passions at once to revolutionize any individual field.

My brain stamina is decent, but not insane. It is physically impossible for me to go over 8 hour weekdays and 4 hour weekend days. I hate that, I hate every non-working second I know that I am "wasting time", I wish I could work all the time, but it is a physical limitation, just like my height. So I bear with myself since I have no choice.
