A home is the reaction vessel of men. Like a cell, it has many subsystems: energy, waste, information. Some men come in, and more come out.

"What you are afraid to do is a clear indication of the next thing you need to do." by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson really resonated with me... E.g. I wanted to study Physics at university, by chickened out because I was afraid I wouldn't get a job. Later on in life, I always felt I missed the deeper physics and mathematics background, just for the beauty of it. Of course, it is impossible to say how things would have gone had I done that, and they did go really well regardless since I started programming, just I felt it took more time than necessary.

Europe is becoming weak because the countries are too small, US and China companies will always eat up the best European ones: https://www.economist.com/europe/2018/10/13/europes-history-explains-why-it-will-never-produce-a-google There is only one solution: everyone must speak English. All school and university courses must be given in English. This will never happen, and Europe will continue to decay :-)

Interest if formed through habit, through seeing that your peers are interested in something on a daily basis. I see that clearly in my job, where being close to people's needs inspired me to learn and do a lot of things I would never had heard of otherwise. This is why a vibrant tech community is so key to one's development, you just go along. In that sense, individual events are not very important. What truly matters is being able to see continuous interest of peers through Q&A websites, paper contributions, software contributions, etc.

The natural sciences are not just a tool to predict the future. They are a reminder that the lives that we live are mere illusions, just like Buddhists say. We know nothing about the materials that we touch every day, nor more importantly how our brain and cells work. Everything is out of our control. The natural sciences make us peek into a little of those unknowns, and blow our minds as we notice that we don't know anything. Today I've been elated by that thought.

Life is too short for closed source.

Molecular biology is a lot like embedded systems:

- small, complex, low observability
- one way to understand what something does it to take them out. On cells, remove a gene. On code, remove a function.
- we sometimes need some instrumentation to increase visibility at the cost of less representative data. On cells, edit genome to add fluorescent stuff. On code, tracepoints.

By self or people I know.

Every problem is trivial given enough observability. Inspiration: programming with debugging, lack of data in natural sciences. Counter argument: economy. Counter counter argument: simple but large state and chaotic.

Everything software is open source when you write assembly code. By P.

I live on the software hardware interface.

I like working in a good train with power charger, no trip companions, and not much shaking. Internet helps, but is optional. Done some hardcore C stuff in them. No distractions. Just you and the source.

Chuck Norris can parse pseudocode. (After my colleague was doing that in a project.)

If a product of a big company has a name that is too catchy, it is an acquisition. Otherwise, the name would be just "Big Company Product Description".

It's fun being at ARM. I look up some public information, then have an unanswered question, I can just look it up on the internal wiki.

Being in a stable relationship, but living separately and in the same time zone is the optimal way to work more (while at ARM Cambridge UK, fiancee in Paris)

Short thoughts which I had and amused me for a few seconds.

Having to fill those ugly .docx forms for enterprises makes me sick. Huge turnoff. Almost certain that they won't understand what you want you know, and what you want to do. Talking to someone is the only way for they to understand what you want to do.

Love watching my colleagues freely mixing French and Arab every 2 sentences when talking to their personal friends.

To succeed in creation: be half action, half planing. (2014-03, while developing GitLab, before success =))

We all need a spice of madness to take on the madness that is the world.

Without technology, one cannot survive. Without art, one cannot live.

Why do countries with the term "Democratic" or related on their official name, tend to be the least democratic? **People**'s Republic of China, "**Democratic** Republic of Congo".

Financial institutions make a lot of money. As a consequence, they adopt new technologies very quickly. The very contrary of educational institutions.

There is a close link between disruptive tech, and the desire to find bugs / exploits in systems. Both of them destabilize enterprises. Woz and Jobs started like that: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_box

Turing completeness is enough for mathematicians. Humans however need "runs Debian".
