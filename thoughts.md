# Thoughts

I can't believe I've posted this on Facebook!!! https://www.facebook.com/cirosantilli/posts/128228673862284 Was reminded by a do you want to share it thingy. It's from when I started dating my wife and we were fighting:

    Theorem 1.1 (Love sucks).

    Let P(A L B)
    be the probability that person A loves person B and h(A) be the
    measure of happiness of person A

    Then:

    P( h(A) = 0) = 1 - P(A L B)
    P( h(A) = -1) = P(A L B)[ 1 - P(B L A) ]
    P( h(A) = 1) = P(A L B)P(B L A)

    Since P(A L B) = P(B L A) ~ 0, average(h) < 0

Just look at those comments as well. I remember those days at Polytechnique, I wouldn't do anything during weekends, just learn Chinese, maths and physics and think deeply about the world in my little studio.

I've been watching some climbing videos, like Free Solo movie 2019. After one of them, I was checking my Stack Overflow as I do obsessively, and had a mini-epiphany: this is my wall. The wall of answers. And I strive to climb it. But it is a small wall. The big wall, is yet to be climbed: the wall of the stupidity of our educational system.

I love it when I'm compiling something in the evening and my cooler is making rain-like sounds. Feels like s like I'm being productive without actual effort, and reminds me of the relaxing rain sounds. And the lack of sound informs me that the compilation has finished, and the I can continue to the next step.

In the physical sciences, what matters most is not what we know, but how we know it. School gets that fundamentally wrong. The method and tools are everything. And it usually comes down to how scientists managed to observe and control something very subtle in a new way.

A home is the reaction vessel of men. Like a cell, it has many subsystems: energy, waste, information. Some men come in, some food comes in, and more men come out.

"What you are afraid to do is a clear indication of the next thing you need to do." by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson really resonated with me... E.g. I wanted to study Physics at university, by chickened out because I was afraid I wouldn't get a job. Later on in life, I always felt I missed the deeper physics and mathematics background, just for the beauty of it. Of course, it is impossible to say how things would have gone had I done that, and they did go really well regardless since I started programming, just I felt it took more time than necessary.

Interest if formed through habit, through seeing that your peers are interested in something on a daily basis. I see that clearly in my job, where being close to people's needs inspired me to learn and do a lot of things I would never had heard of otherwise. This is why a vibrant tech community is so key to one's development, you just go along. In that sense, individual events are not very important. What truly matters is being able to see continuous interest of peers through Q&A websites, paper contributions, software contributions, etc.

Molecular biology is a lot like embedded systems:

- small, complex, low observability
- one way to understand what something does it to take them out. On cells, remove a gene. On code, remove a function.
- we sometimes need some instrumentation to increase visibility at the cost of less representative data. On cells, edit genome to add fluorescent stuff. On code, tracepoints.

By self or people I know.

Every problem is trivial given enough observability. Inspiration: programming with debugging, lack of data in natural sciences. Counter argument: economy. Counter counter argument: simple but large state and chaotic.

I live on the software hardware interface.

I like working in a good train with power charger, no trip companions, and not much shaking. Internet helps, but is optional. Done some hardcore C stuff in them. No distractions. Just you and the source.

If a product of a big company has a name that is too catchy, it is an acquisition. Otherwise, the name would be just "Big Company Product Description".

It's fun being at ARM. I look up some public information, then have an unanswered question, I can just look it up on the internal wiki.

Being in a stable relationship, but living separately and in the same time zone is the optimal way to work more (while at ARM Cambridge UK, fiancee in Paris)

Having to fill those ugly .docx forms for enterprises makes me sick. Huge turnoff. Almost certain that they won't understand what you want you know, and what you want to do. Talking to someone is the only way for they to understand what you want to do.

Love watching my colleagues freely mixing French and Arab every 2 sentences when talking to their personal friends.

To succeed in creation: be half action, half planing. (2014-03, while developing GitLab, before success =))

We all need a spice of madness to take on the madness that is the world.

Why do countries with the term "Democratic" or related on their official name, tend to be the least democratic? **People**'s Republic of China, "**Democratic** Republic of Congo".
